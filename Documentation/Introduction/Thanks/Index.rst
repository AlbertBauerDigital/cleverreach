This extension and manual has been created in endless hours, mostly by a single person.
It is actively maintained to fit all supported TYPO3 versions, user interface concepts and best practice approaches.

If this extension helps you in anyway to achieve your requirements, please think about giving something back.
Or you want to sponsor a feature to extend something that's already there? Then find some ideas to make me happy below - I'm looking forward to geting in contact with you!

Nice mails
^^^^^^^^^^
Some nice words fit every time - just drop me some kind words by mail to make me happy :-)

Amazon Wishlist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you like to send me a small gift - feel free to choose from my Amazon Wishlist (https://www.amazon.de/registry/wishlist/X92KWDEBX6V4/) where I have collected some smaller and medium wishes that wait to be sponsored by someone :-)

Let's have a cocoa/bionade
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're in the region of Aachen-Cologne-DÃ¼sseldorf, just let me know. I'm always looking forward to meeting new and known faces and to exchange on several topics.

I am also attending meetings of the TYPO3 Usergroup Niederrhein | Euregio which can be found at http://www.tugnr.de/.

Money
^^^^^
If you have too much of it and want to share parts of your money with me, just let me know and we'll find a way to organize that :-)
